            <h2>Introduction: The Language of Business</h2>
            <p>Financial Accounting is the systematic process of recording, summarizing, and reporting a company's financial transactions. It provides a clear picture of a company's performance and financial position to external stakeholders like investors, creditors, and regulators. This course is meticulously structured to guide you through the complete accounting cycle, transforming your perspective from a mere bookkeeper to a preliminary financial analyst.</p>
            <p>The pedagogical approach ensures you first understand the 'why' behind accounting rules—the fundamental principles and concepts—before mastering the 'how' of the mechanical processes. By the end of this course, you will be able to prepare and interpret the key financial statements that are the bedrock of all financial analysis. This skill is non-negotiable for any aspiring manager, as it provides the basis for budgeting, investment decisions, and performance evaluation.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: The Conceptual Framework of Accounting</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Introduction to Accounting</h3>
            <p>This section lays the conceptual foundation, introducing the principles and terminology that govern the entire field of accounting. It defines the purpose and scope of accounting and identifies who uses the information it generates.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meaning and Scope:</strong> Accounting is formally defined as "the art of recording, classifying, and summarizing in a significant manner and in terms of money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of a financial character, and interpreting the results thereof." Its scope is broad, encompassing bookkeeping (the recording phase), financial reporting, cost accounting, management accounting, tax accounting, and auditing. The primary objectives are to maintain systematic and complete records of business transactions, ascertain the profit or loss of the business, determine the financial position (what it owns and owes), and communicate this information to interested parties.</li>
                <li><strong>Users of Accounting Information:</strong> The users of accounting information are categorized into two groups:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Internal Users:</strong> These are individuals within the organization, primarily management. They use accounting information for planning, controlling, and decision-making. For example, they use it to set budgets, evaluate the performance of different departments, and make pricing decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>External Users:</strong> These are individuals or organizations outside the company. Key external users include investors (to decide whether to buy, hold, or sell shares), creditors and lenders (to assess the company's ability to repay loans), government and tax authorities (to ensure compliance with tax laws), and customers (to assess the long-term viability of a supplier).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Basic Accounting Terms:</strong> Understanding the vocabulary is the first step to fluency. Key terms include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Asset:</strong> An economic resource owned by the business that is expected to provide future economic benefits (e.g., cash, inventory, machinery, buildings).</li>
                        <li><strong>Liability:</strong> An obligation of the business to pay a certain amount to outsiders in the future (e.g., loans, amounts owed to suppliers).</li>
                        <li><strong>Capital (Owner's Equity):</strong> The owner's claim on the assets of the business. It is the amount invested by the owner, plus any profits, minus any drawings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> The income generated from the sale of goods or services, or other use of capital or assets, associated with the main operations of an organization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Expense:</strong> The cost incurred in the process of earning revenue (e.g., salaries, rent, utilities).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</h3>
            <p>GAAP is the common set of accounting principles, standards, and procedures that companies must follow when they compile their financial statements. These principles act as the ground rules, ensuring that financial reporting is transparent, consistent, and comparable across different companies and industries.</p>
            <h4>Key Accounting Concepts & Conventions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Separate Entity Concept:</strong> This is the most fundamental concept. It states that the business is treated as a distinct entity, separate from its owner(s). All transactions are recorded from the viewpoint of the business, not the owner.</li>
                <li><strong>Money Measurement Concept:</strong> Only those transactions and events that can be measured and expressed in monetary terms are recorded in the books of accounts. This provides a common denominator for reporting.</li>
                <li><strong>Going Concern Concept:</strong> Accounting assumes that the business will continue to operate for the foreseeable future and will not be forced to liquidate. This is why assets are recorded at their original cost and depreciated, rather than at their current market value.</li>
                <li><strong>Dual Aspect Concept:</strong> This is the foundation of the double-entry bookkeeping system. It states that every transaction has two aspects: a debit and a credit. For every debit, there must be a corresponding credit. This gives rise to the fundamental accounting equation: <strong>Assets = Liabilities + Capital</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Accounting Period Concept:</strong> The life of a business is indefinite, but for performance measurement, it is divided into shorter, artificial time periods, typically one year. This allows for the regular preparation of financial statements.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Concept (Historical Cost):</strong> Assets are recorded in the books of account at the price at which they were acquired. This cost serves as the basis for all subsequent accounting for the asset.</li>
                <li><strong>Matching Concept:</strong> This principle dictates that expenses incurred in an accounting period should be matched with the revenues earned during that same period to determine the correct profit or loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Convention of Conservatism (Prudence):</strong> This convention advises that when in doubt, an accountant should choose the method that is least likely to overstate profits and assets. It means recognizing all anticipated losses but not recognizing anticipated profits.</li>
                <li><strong>Convention of Full Disclosure:</strong> All significant information that could influence a user's decision must be disclosed in the financial statements, either in the body of the statements or in the footnotes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: The Accounting Cycle - Recording Transactions</h2>
            <p>This section covers the mechanical, step-by-step process of recording financial transactions. This cycle begins with a transaction and ends with the preparation of financial statements and closing the books.</p>
            
            <h3>2.1 Journal and Ledger</h3>
            <p>The process begins with capturing transactions and organizing them into accounts using the double-entry system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Accounting Equation & Rules of Debit and Credit:</strong> The entire system is built on the equation: Assets = Liabilities + Capital. To maintain this balance, rules of debit and credit are used.
                    <ul>
                        <li>For <strong>Assets</strong> and <strong>Expenses</strong>: An increase is a Debit, and a decrease is a Credit.</li>
                        <li>For <strong>Liabilities</strong>, <strong>Capital</strong>, and <strong>Revenue</strong>: An increase is a Credit, and a decrease is a Debit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Journalizing:</strong> This is the first step in the recording process. Transactions are recorded chronologically in a book called the "Journal." Each entry, known as a journal entry, shows the accounts that have been debited and credited, along with a brief explanation of the transaction (narration).</li>
                <li><strong>Ledger Posting:</strong> The Ledger is the principal book of accounts where transactions are classified and summarized by account. The process of transferring the debit and credit items from the Journal to their respective accounts in the Ledger is called "posting." After posting, each account is balanced to find its net position.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Subsidiary Books and Trial Balance</h3>
            <p>For businesses with a large volume of similar transactions, recording every transaction in the main journal is impractical. Therefore, the journal is sub-divided into special-purpose books.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sub-Division of Journal (Subsidiary Books):</strong> These books are used to record specific types of transactions. The most common ones are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cash Book:</strong> Records all cash receipts and payments. It serves as both a subsidiary book and a ledger account.</li>
                        <li><strong>Purchases Book:</strong> Records all credit purchases of goods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sales Book:</strong> Records all credit sales of goods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Purchases Return Book:</strong> Records goods returned to suppliers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sales Return Book:</strong> Records goods returned by customers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Journal Proper:</strong> Records transactions that cannot be recorded in any other subsidiary book, such as opening entries, closing entries, and adjustment entries.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Trial Balance:</strong> After posting to the ledger and balancing the accounts, a statement called the Trial Balance is prepared. It is a list of all ledger account balances. The total of the debit balances must equal the total of the credit balances. The primary purpose of the trial balance is to verify the arithmetical accuracy of the bookkeeping work. It also serves as the basis for preparing the final financial statements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 3: Preparation of Final Accounts</h2>
            <p>This is the culmination of the accounting cycle, focusing on the year-end procedures required to accurately measure financial performance and position. The final accounts provide a summary of the business's operations for the year.</p>
            
            <h3>3.1 Year-End Adjustments</h3>
            <p>The trial balance is prepared before considering certain adjustments. To ensure that the financial statements present a "true and fair" view and comply with the matching principle, several adjustment entries are necessary.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Capital vs. Revenue:</strong> It is crucial to distinguish between capital expenditure/receipts and revenue expenditure/receipts. Capital items have long-term benefits and are shown on the balance sheet (e.g., purchase of machinery). Revenue items relate to the current period and are shown in the income statement (e.g., payment of salaries).</li>
                <li><strong>Depreciation:</strong> Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. It is an expense that reflects the asset's wear and tear. Common methods include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Straight-Line Method (SLM):</strong> (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life. This method allocates an equal amount of depreciation each year.</li>
                        <li><strong>Written-Down Value (WDV) Method:</strong> Depreciation is charged at a fixed percentage on the book value of the asset each year. The depreciation amount decreases over time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Inventory Valuation:</strong> Closing stock (inventory) must be valued at the end of the accounting period. According to the principle of conservatism, it is valued at cost or net realizable value, whichever is lower. Common cost formulas include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>FIFO (First-In, First-Out):</strong> Assumes that the first units purchased are the first ones sold.</li>
                        <li><strong>LIFO (Last-In, First-Out):</strong> Assumes that the last units purchased are the first ones sold. (Note: LIFO is not permitted under International Financial Reporting Standards).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Other Adjustments:</strong> Common adjustments also include accounting for outstanding expenses, prepaid expenses, accrued income, and income received in advance.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3.2 Financial Statements</h3>
            <p>The final output of the accounting process, these statements tell the financial story of the company for the accounting period.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trading and Profit & Loss Account (Income Statement):</strong> This statement is prepared to determine the financial performance of the business over a period of time. It is prepared in two parts:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>Trading Account</strong> is prepared to find out the Gross Profit or Gross Loss, which is the difference between sales and the direct cost of goods sold.</li>
                        <li>The <strong>Profit & Loss Account</strong> starts with the gross profit/loss and is charged with all indirect operating expenses (e.g., salaries, rent, advertising) to arrive at the Net Profit or Net Loss for the period.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position):</strong> This statement presents a snapshot of the company's financial position on a specific date (usually the last day of the accounting period). It shows what the business owns (Assets) and what it owes (Liabilities and Capital). The Balance Sheet must always balance, confirming the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Capital.</li>
            </ul>
