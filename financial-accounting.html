            <h2>Introduction: The Language of Business</h2>
            <p>Financial Accounting is the systematic process of recording, summarizing, and reporting a company's financial transactions. It provides a clear picture of a company's performance and financial position to external stakeholders like investors, creditors, and regulators. This course is meticulously structured to guide you through the complete accounting cycle, transforming your perspective from a mere bookkeeper to a preliminary financial analyst.</p>
            <p>The pedagogical approach ensures you first understand the 'why' behind accounting rules—the fundamental principles and concepts—before mastering the 'how' of the mechanical processes. By the end of this course, you will be able to prepare and interpret the key financial statements that are the bedrock of all financial analysis.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: The Conceptual Framework of Accounting</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Introduction to Accounting</h3>
            <p>This section lays the conceptual foundation, introducing the principles and terminology that govern the entire field of accounting.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meaning and Scope:</strong> Defines accounting as an information system and outlines its primary objectives, such as maintaining systematic records and communicating financial results.</li>
                <li><strong>Users of Accounting Information:</strong> Identifies the various internal (management) and external (investors, creditors, government) stakeholders who rely on financial information for decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Accounting Terms:</strong> Introduces the essential vocabulary, including definitions of Asset, Liability, Capital, Revenue, Expense, Debtor, and Creditor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)</h3>
            <p>GAAP provides the fundamental concepts and conventions that ensure consistency and comparability in financial reporting. These principles are the ground rules for the language of business.</p>
            <h4>Key Accounting Concepts:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Separate Entity Concept:</strong> The business is treated as a separate legal entity from its owners.</li>
                <li><strong>Money Measurement Concept:</strong> Only transactions that can be expressed in monetary terms are recorded.</li>
                <li><strong>Going Concern Concept:</strong> The business is assumed to continue operating for the foreseeable future.</li>
                <li><strong>Dual Aspect Concept:</strong> Every transaction has two effects, giving rise to the fundamental accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Capital.</li>
                <li><strong>Accounting Period Concept:</strong> The life of the business is divided into smaller time periods (e.g., one year) for performance measurement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: The Accounting Cycle - Recording Transactions</h2>
            <p>This section covers the mechanical, step-by-step process of recording financial transactions, which forms the core of bookkeeping.</p>
            
            <h3>2.1 Journal and Ledger</h3>
            <p>The process begins with capturing transactions and organizing them into accounts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Accounting Equation:</strong> Introduces the fundamental relationship: Assets = Liabilities + Capital, which is the basis of the double-entry system.</li>
                <li><strong>Journalizing:</strong> The process of recording transactions chronologically in the book of original entry (the Journal) using the rules of Debit and Credit.</li>
                <li><strong>Ledger Posting:</strong> Transferring entries from the journal to their respective accounts in the principal book (the Ledger), followed by the balancing of these accounts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Subsidiary Books and Trial Balance</h3>
            <p>To handle high volumes of transactions efficiently, special-purpose books are used.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sub-Division of Journal:</strong> Details the use of subsidiary books like the Cash Book, Purchases Book, and Sales Book.</li>
                <li><strong>Trial Balance:</strong> Explains the preparation of a trial balance to verify the arithmetical accuracy of the ledger and to serve as a basis for preparing the final accounts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 3: Preparation of Final Accounts</h2>
            <p>This is the culmination of the accounting cycle, focusing on the year-end procedures required to accurately measure financial performance and position.</p>
            
            <h3>3.1 Year-End Adjustments</h3>
            <p>Before preparing the final statements, several adjustments are needed to ensure the accounts reflect a true and fair view.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Capital vs. Revenue:</strong> Teaches the crucial distinction between capital items (long-term benefits, shown on the balance sheet) and revenue items (current period, shown in the income statement).</li>
                <li><strong>Depreciation:</strong> Introduces common methods for calculating depreciation, such as the Straight-Line Method (SLM) and Written-Down Value (WDV) Method.</li>
                <li><strong>Inventory Valuation:</strong> Discusses key methods like FIFO (First-In, First-Out) and LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) and their impact on reported profit.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3.2 Financial Statements</h3>
            <p>The final output of the accounting process, these statements tell the financial story of the company.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trading and Profit & Loss Account:</strong> This statement, also known as the Income Statement, is prepared to calculate the net profit or loss for the accounting period.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> This statement presents a snapshot of the company's financial position at a specific point in time, showing what it owns (Assets) and what it owes (Liabilities).</li>
            </ul>
