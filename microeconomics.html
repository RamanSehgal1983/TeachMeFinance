            <h2>Introduction: The Logic of the Market</h2>
            <p>Microeconomics furnishes the fundamental logic of the market environment, equipping students with the analytical tools needed for robust business strategy, competitive analysis, and informed decision-making regarding pricing and production. The course follows a logical "micro-to-meso" progression. It begins by examining the decision-making process of the individual consumer, then shifts to the operational and cost considerations of the firm, and finally analyzes the interaction between these two agents across a spectrum of different market structures. It is the science of how individuals and businesses make choices under conditions of scarcity and the consequences of those choices for markets and the broader economy.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Economics and Market Forces</h2>
            <h3>1.1 The Economic Problem</h3>
            <p>This section introduces the fundamental concepts that define the field of economics. At its core, economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scarcity and Choice:</strong> The central economic problem is the conflict between unlimited human wants and limited resources. Because we cannot have everything we want, we must make choices. Every choice involves a trade-off. The concept of <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong> is crucial here: it is the value of the next-best alternative that must be forgone to pursue a certain action. For example, the opportunity cost of attending college includes not just tuition fees but also the wages you could have earned by working instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Economic Problems:</strong> Every society must answer three fundamental questions:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>What to produce?</strong> Which goods and services should be produced and in what quantities?</li>
                        <li><strong>How to produce?</strong> What combination of resources (land, labor, capital) should be used to produce these goods and services?</li>
                        <li><strong>For whom to produce?</strong> Who gets to consume the goods and services that are produced? How is the economic output distributed among the population?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Economic Systems:</strong> Societies have developed different systems to answer these questions:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Free Market (Capitalist) Economy:</strong> Decisions are made by individual households and firms interacting in markets. Prices act as signals that guide the allocation of resources.</li>
                        <li><strong>Command (Socialist) Economy:</strong> A central authority (usually the government) makes the key economic decisions about production and distribution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mixed Economy:</strong> This is a hybrid system that combines elements of both market and command economies, which is the model for most modern countries.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium</h3>
            <p>This part explains the core market forces that determine the prices and quantities of goods and services. The model of supply and demand is the economist's most powerful tool.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Demand and Supply:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Demand:</strong> The quantity of a good that buyers are willing and able to purchase at various prices. The <strong>Law of Demand</strong> states that, other things being equal, as the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded rises. The demand curve is downward sloping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Supply:</strong> The quantity of a good that sellers are willing and able to sell at various prices. The <strong>Law of Supply</strong> states that, other things being equal, as the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied rises. The supply curve is upward sloping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Market Equilibrium:</strong> This occurs at the price where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. This price is the equilibrium price, and the corresponding quantity is the equilibrium quantity. At this point, the market "clears."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Elasticity of Demand:</strong> Elasticity measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in one of its determinants. It is a critical concept for business pricing strategy.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):</strong> Measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in price. If PED > 1, demand is elastic (a price change leads to a larger percentage change in quantity demanded). If PED < 1, demand is inelastic. This concept is crucial for determining how a change in price will affect a firm's total revenue.</li>
                        <li><strong>Income Elasticity of Demand (YED):</strong> Measures how much the quantity demanded responds to a change in consumer income. It helps distinguish between normal goods (positive YED) and inferior goods (negative YED).</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED):</strong> Measures how much the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good. It helps identify substitute goods (positive XED) and complementary goods (negative XED).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: Theory of Consumer Behavior</h2>
            <p>This section delves into the logic behind consumer choices and the foundations of demand. It seeks to answer the question: how do consumers allocate their limited income among various goods and services to maximize their satisfaction?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Utility Analysis (Cardinal Approach):</strong> This approach assumes that utility (satisfaction) can be measured in cardinal numbers.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Total and Marginal Utility:</strong> Total Utility (TU) is the total satisfaction derived from consuming a certain quantity of a good. Marginal Utility (MU) is the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good.</li>
                        <li><strong>Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility:</strong> This fundamental law states that as a person consumes more and more units of a good, the additional satisfaction (marginal utility) derived from each successive unit goes on decreasing. This is the reason why the demand curve slopes downwards.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Indifference Curve Analysis (Ordinal Approach):</strong> This is a more modern approach that assumes utility can only be ranked in order of preference, not measured.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Indifference Curve (IC):</strong> A curve that shows various combinations of two goods that give the consumer equal satisfaction. Key properties of ICs are that they are downward sloping, convex to the origin, and never intersect.</li>
                        <li><strong>Budget Line:</strong> A line that shows the different combinations of two goods that a consumer can afford given their income and the prices of the goods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consumer Equilibrium:</strong> A consumer maximizes their satisfaction at the point where their budget line is tangent to the highest attainable indifference curve. At this point, the marginal rate of substitution between the two goods is equal to the ratio of their prices.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 3: Theory of Production and Cost</h2>
            <p>This part shifts focus from the consumer to the firm. It examines the relationship between inputs (factors of production) and outputs, and the nature of production costs, which are critical for supply decisions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Theory of Production:</strong> Production involves transforming inputs (like labor and capital) into outputs (goods and services).
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Production Function:</strong> A mathematical expression that shows the relationship between the quantity of inputs used and the maximum quantity of output that can be produced.</li>
                        <li><strong>Law of Variable Proportions (Short Run):</strong> This law analyzes production when one input is variable and others are fixed. It states that as we increase the quantity of one variable input, keeping other inputs fixed, the marginal product of that input will eventually decline. This gives rise to the three stages of production: increasing, diminishing, and negative returns.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Theory of Cost:</strong> A firm's costs are a key determinant of its production and pricing decisions.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cost Concepts:</strong> Costs can be classified as explicit costs (direct monetary payments) and implicit costs (opportunity costs of using self-owned resources). Economic profit considers both, while accounting profit considers only explicit costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Short-Run Costs:</strong> In the short run, some costs are fixed and some are variable. We analyze Total Cost (TC), Total Fixed Cost (TFC), Total Variable Cost (TVC), Average Fixed Cost (AFC), Average Variable Cost (AVC), Average Total Cost (ATC), and Marginal Cost (MC). The relationship between these cost curves (e.g., the U-shape of the average and marginal cost curves) is crucial for understanding a firm's behavior.</li>
                        <li><strong>Long-Run Costs:</strong> In the long run, all inputs are variable. The long-run average cost curve shows the lowest possible average cost of producing any level of output.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 4: Market Structures</h2>
            <p>The final section analyzes how firms behave and how prices are determined in different competitive environments. The structure of a market is defined by the number of firms, the nature of the product, and the ease of entry and exit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perfect Competition:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Features:</strong> Very large number of buyers and sellers, homogeneous (identical) product, free entry and exit of firms, and perfect information. Firms are "price takers."</li>
                        <li><strong>Price-Output Determination:</strong> The firm's demand curve is perfectly elastic. In the short run, a firm can make super-normal profits, normal profits, or losses. In the long run, due to free entry and exit, firms will only earn normal profits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Monopoly:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Features:</strong> Single seller, no close substitutes for the product, and strong barriers to entry. The monopolist is a "price maker."</li>
                        <li><strong>Price-Output Determination:</strong> The monopolist faces the entire market demand curve. They maximize profit by producing where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Monopolists can earn super-normal profits even in the long run due to barriers to entry.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Monopolistic Competition:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Features:</strong> Large number of firms, differentiated products (through branding, quality, etc.), and free entry and exit. It's a blend of monopoly and perfect competition.</li>
                        <li><strong>Price-Output Determination:</strong> Each firm has a small degree of monopoly power due to product differentiation. In the short run, firms can earn super-normal profits, but in the long run, they only earn normal profits as new firms enter the market.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Oligopoly:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Features:</strong> A few large firms dominate the market, selling either homogeneous or differentiated products. There are significant barriers to entry. The key feature is <strong>interdependence</strong>—each firm's actions affect its rivals, and it must consider their reactions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Price-Output Determination:</strong> Behavior is strategic and complex. Models like the kinked demand curve are used to explain price rigidity in oligopolistic markets. Firms may engage in collusion (forming cartels) or non-price competition (like advertising).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
