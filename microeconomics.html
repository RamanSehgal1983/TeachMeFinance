            <h2>Introduction: The Logic of the Market</h2>
            <p>Microeconomics furnishes the fundamental logic of the market environment, equipping students with the analytical tools needed for robust business strategy, competitive analysis, and informed decision-making regarding pricing and production. The course follows a logical "micro-to-meso" progression. It begins by examining the decision-making process of the individual consumer, then shifts to the operational and cost considerations of the firm, and finally analyzes the interaction between these two agents across a spectrum of different market structures.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Economics and Market Forces</h2>
            <h3>1.1 The Economic Problem</h3>
            <p>This section introduces the fundamental concepts that define the field of economics.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scarcity and Choice:</strong> Explores the core issue of economics: scarcity of resources versus unlimited wants, which necessitates choice and gives rise to the concept of opportunity cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Economic Problems:</strong> Addresses the three central questions any economy must answer: What to produce? How to produce? and For whom to produce?</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Systems:</strong> Compares and contrasts different ways societies organize their economies, including the Free Market (Capitalist), Command (Socialist), and Mixed economic systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium</h3>
            <p>This part explains the core market forces that determine the prices and quantities of goods and services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Demand and Supply:</strong> Introduces the Law of Demand and the Law of Supply, and demonstrates how their interaction determines the equilibrium price and quantity in a market.</li>
                <li><strong>Elasticity of Demand:</strong> A crucial concept for business pricing strategy, this topic covers Price Elasticity, Income Elasticity, and Cross Elasticity of Demand, including their calculation and interpretation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: Theory of Consumer Behavior</h2>
            <p>This section delves into the logic behind consumer choices and the foundations of demand, explaining how consumers allocate their income to maximize satisfaction.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Utility Analysis:</strong> Covers the Cardinal utility approach, explaining concepts like Total and Marginal Utility and the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility.</li>
                <li><strong>Indifference Curve Analysis:</strong> Introduces the Ordinal utility approach, using indifference curves and budget lines to illustrate consumer preferences and determine consumer equilibrium.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 3: Theory of Production and Cost</h2>
            <p>This part shifts focus to the firm, examining the relationship between inputs and outputs, and the nature of production costs, which are critical for supply decisions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Theory of Production:</strong> Introduces the concept of the production function and analyzes short-run production with the Law of Variable Proportions (or Law of Diminishing Returns).</li>
                <li><strong>Theory of Cost:</strong> Defines and analyzes various cost concepts, including short-run and long-run costs, fixed and variable costs, and the critically important average and marginal costs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 4: Market Structures</h2>
            <p>The final section analyzes how firms behave and how prices are determined in different competitive environments, providing a framework for competitive strategy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Perfect Competition:</strong> Analyzes how price and output are determined for the firm and industry in a market with many firms and a homogeneous product.</li>
                <li><strong>Monopoly:</strong> Explains how a single seller with no close substitutes determines price and output to maximize profit.</li>
                <li><strong>Monopolistic Competition:</strong> Discusses price and output determination in a market with many firms selling differentiated products.</li>
                <li><strong>Oligopoly:</strong> Introduces the key features of a market dominated by a few large firms, such as interdependence and strategic behavior.</li>
            </ul>
