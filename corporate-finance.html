            <h2>Introduction: Advanced Financial Decision Making</h2>
            <p>Corporate Finance deals with the financial decisions that corporations make and the tools and analysis used to make these decisions. While Financial Management provides the foundational principles, Corporate Finance delves deeper into the complexities of these decisions in a dynamic and often uncertain environment. The primary goal remains the maximization of shareholder value, but the focus shifts to more complex scenarios involving risk, valuation of entire businesses, and strategic financial decisions like mergers and acquisitions. This course will equip you with the advanced analytical skills needed to navigate the sophisticated world of corporate financial strategy.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: Advanced Capital Budgeting</h2>
            <p>This module extends the principles of capital budgeting by incorporating risk and uncertainty into the investment decision-making process.</p>
            
            <h3>1.1 Risk Analysis in Capital Budgeting</h3>
            <p>Traditional capital budgeting techniques like NPV and IRR assume that future cash flows are known with certainty. In reality, cash flows are uncertain. This section introduces techniques to formally incorporate risk into the analysis.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensitivity Analysis:</strong> A technique that examines how the NPV of a project changes in response to a change in a single input variable (e.g., sales volume, variable cost), holding all other variables constant. It helps to identify the most critical variables affecting a project's outcome.</li>
                <li><strong>Scenario Analysis:</strong> An extension of sensitivity analysis where we analyze the project's NPV under different scenarios (e.g., pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic). This provides a range of possible outcomes and a better understanding of the project's risk profile.</li>
                <li><strong>Simulation (Monte Carlo Simulation):</strong> A sophisticated technique where a computer model is used to generate a probability distribution of the project's NPV by randomly selecting values for each uncertain variable from their respective probability distributions.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk-Adjusted Discount Rate (RADR):</strong> This approach adjusts for risk by using a higher discount rate for riskier projects. The RADR is the risk-free rate plus a risk premium that reflects the project's specific risk.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: Long-Term Financing Decisions</h2>
            <p>This module provides a detailed look at the various sources of long-term finance available to a corporation and the process of raising capital from the market.</p>
            
            <h3>2.1 Sources of Long-Term Finance</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Equity Capital:</strong> Issuing new shares to the public (Initial Public Offering - IPO or Further Public Offering - FPO) or through private placements.</li>
                <li><strong>Debt Capital:</strong> Issuing debentures or bonds, or taking term loans from financial institutions. We explore different features of debt, such as maturity, interest rate (fixed vs. floating), and security.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Securities:</strong> Instruments that have features of both debt and equity, such as convertible debentures and preference shares.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Leasing</h3>
            <p>Leasing is a method of obtaining the use of assets for a specified period without owning them. It is a popular alternative to purchasing assets. We analyze the lease vs. buy decision from a financial perspective, comparing the present value of the cost of leasing with the present value of the cost of owning.</p>

            <h2>Module 3: Advanced Capital Structure and Dividend Decisions</h2>
            <p>This module revisits the financing and dividend decisions in greater depth, exploring more nuanced theories and practical considerations.</p>

            <h3>3.1 Advanced Capital Structure Theories</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pecking Order Theory:</strong> This theory suggests that firms have a preferred hierarchy for financing. They prefer to use internal funds (retained earnings) first, then debt, and finally, as a last resort, issue new equity. This is because of asymmetric information between managers and investors.</li>
                <li><strong>Trade-off Theory:</strong> This theory posits that the optimal capital structure is a trade-off between the tax benefits of debt and the costs of financial distress (e.g., bankruptcy costs).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 Dividend Policy in Practice</h3>
            <p>We move beyond the theoretical models of dividend relevance to discuss the practical factors that influence a firm's dividend policy. These include legal constraints, liquidity position, access to capital markets, and shareholder expectations. We also discuss alternative ways to distribute profits to shareholders, such as share buybacks.</p>

            <h2>Module 4: Corporate Restructuring and Valuation</h2>
            <p>This module covers major strategic financial decisions that can significantly alter a company's structure and value.</p>

            <h3>4.1 Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)</h3>
            <p>M&A are a key tool for corporate growth and restructuring. A merger is a combination of two companies into one, while an acquisition is when one company takes over another.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motives for M&A:</strong> These can include achieving synergies (economies of scale, operational efficiencies), diversification, tax benefits, or market power.</li>
                <li><strong>Types of Mergers:</strong> Horizontal (between competitors), Vertical (between a firm and its supplier/customer), and Conglomerate (between unrelated firms).</li>
                <li><strong>Valuation in M&A:</strong> A critical part of any M&A deal is valuing the target company to determine a fair acquisition price. Common valuation methods include the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, comparable company analysis, and precedent transaction analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.2 Corporate Valuation</h3>
            <p>Corporate valuation is the process of determining the economic value of a whole business or a company unit. It is essential for M&A, investment decisions, and financial reporting.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation:</strong> This is the most common approach. It involves forecasting the company's future free cash flows and discounting them back to the present value using the company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).</li>
                <li><strong>Relative Valuation:</strong> This method values a company by comparing it to similar companies based on valuation multiples like the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, or EV/EBITDA multiple.</li>
            </ul>
