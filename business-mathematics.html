            <h2>Introduction: Mathematics for Data-Driven Decisions</h2>
            <p>Business Mathematics is engineered to provide students with the quantitative tools necessary for data-driven decision-making in a commercial context. The curriculum intentionally bridges abstract mathematical theory with concrete business applications, ensuring you grasp the practical relevance of each concept. The progression is designed to build a strong analytical foundation, preparing you for advanced quantitative subjects in later years.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: Foundational Algebraic Concepts</h2>
            <p>This part revisits and strengthens the algebraic skills necessary for all subsequent topics, with a strong emphasis on applying these techniques to business problems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Theory of Sets:</strong> Covers basic set theory, operations like union and intersection, and their visualization through Venn diagrams, providing a foundation for logical classification.</li>
                <li><strong>Equations:</strong> Focuses on solving Linear, Quadratic, and Simultaneous equations, with direct application to business problems like break-even analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Ratios, Proportions, and Percentages:</strong> Covers practical business calculations involving ratios and percentages, such as calculating commission, brokerage, and trade discounts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: Matrix Algebra and Determinants</h2>
            <p>This section introduces a powerful tool for handling and solving large systems of linear equations, which are common in business modeling and optimization problems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Introduction to Matrices:</strong> Defines a matrix and covers different types and the algebra of matrices, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication.</li>
                <li><strong>Determinants and Inverse of a Matrix:</strong> Explains how to calculate the determinant and find the inverse of a matrix, demonstrating its application in solving systems of linear equations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 3: Commercial Arithmetic</h2>
            <p>This part focuses on the specific mathematical applications used in finance and commerce, which are fundamental to all financial calculations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple and Compound Interest:</strong> Covers the calculation of interest, which is fundamental to all finance, including formulas for both simple and compound interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Annuities:</strong> A critical topic for finance, this introduces the concepts of present value and future value of an annuity, used in loan amortization, sinking funds, and investment valuation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 4: Introduction to Calculus and its Applications</h2>
            <p>This section introduces the foundational concepts of calculus, the mathematics of change, and demonstrates its immense power in business optimization.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Differential Calculus (Differentiation):</strong> Introduces the concept of a derivative as a rate of change. It covers the basic rules of differentiation and applies them to business concepts like finding marginal cost and marginal revenue.</li>
                <li><strong>Maxima and Minima:</strong> A crucial application of differentiation, this introduces the concept of using derivatives to find maxima and minima, which is applied to profit maximization and cost minimization problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Integral Calculus (Integration):</strong> Presents integration as the reverse of differentiation. Its primary business application at this level is to calculate total cost or total revenue functions when the corresponding marginal functions are known.</li>
            </ul>
