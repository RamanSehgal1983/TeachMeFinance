            <h2>Introduction: The Goal of Value Maximization</h2>
            <p>Financial Management is the strategic planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of financial undertakings in an organization. It moves beyond the record-keeping of accounting to the critical process of decision-making. The overarching objective of financial management is to maximize the wealth of the shareholders, which in practice means maximizing the market price of the company's stock. This is achieved through a careful balance of three key decisions: where to invest (Investment Decision), where to get funds from (Financing Decision), and what to do with the profits (Dividend Decision). This course is designed to equip you with the analytical tools and theoretical understanding to make these decisions effectively.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: Foundations of Financial Management</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Introduction to Financial Management</h3>
            <p>This section lays the groundwork, defining the scope and objectives of financial management and introducing the core concepts that underpin all financial decisions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nature and Scope:</strong> Financial management involves the acquisition and allocation of a firm's financial resources. Its scope is broad, covering financial planning, capital budgeting, working capital management, and dividend policy. It is integral to the overall management of the firm.</li>
                <li><strong>Objectives of Financial Management:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Profit Maximization:</strong> A traditional objective, this focuses on maximizing the earnings per share. However, it has limitations as it ignores the timing of returns (time value of money) and the risk associated with those returns.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wealth Maximization (Value Maximization):</strong> The modern and superior objective. It focuses on maximizing the market value of the firm's shares. This is a better goal because it considers the timing of cash flows, the risk involved, and the impact on shareholder value.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Time Value of Money:</strong> This is one of the most fundamental concepts in finance. It states that a rupee today is worth more than a rupee tomorrow. This is because today's rupee can be invested to earn interest. This concept is the basis for all valuation, from bonds to stocks to entire companies. We use techniques like compounding (to find future value) and discounting (to find present value) to compare cash flows occurring at different points in time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: The Investment Decision (Capital Budgeting)</h2>
            <p>The investment decision, also known as capital budgeting, is arguably the most important decision a financial manager makes. It involves committing significant funds to long-term assets or projects whose benefits will be realized over several years. A poor capital budgeting decision can have serious long-term consequences for the firm.</p>
            
            <h3>2.1 Capital Budgeting Process</h3>
            <p>This involves a systematic evaluation of potential investment projects. The steps include project identification, project evaluation, project selection, and project implementation and review.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Capital Budgeting Evaluation Techniques</h3>
            <p>We use several techniques to evaluate and compare investment proposals. These are categorized into non-discounting and discounting methods.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Non-Discounting Techniques (Ignore Time Value of Money):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Payback Period (PBP):</strong> This is the length of time it takes for an investment to recover its initial cost from its cash inflows. It is simple to calculate but ignores cash flows after the payback period and the time value of money.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accounting Rate of Return (ARR):</strong> This is the average annual profit after tax divided by the average investment. It is based on accounting profits, not cash flows, and also ignores the time value of money.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Discounting Techniques (Consider Time Value of Money):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Net Present Value (NPV):</strong> This is the difference between the present value of future cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows. A project with a positive NPV should be accepted as it increases shareholder wealth. NPV is considered the most theoretically sound capital budgeting technique.</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Rate of Return (IRR):</strong> This is the discount rate at which the NPV of a project is zero. A project is accepted if its IRR is greater than the company's required rate of return (cost of capital).</li>
                        <li><strong>Profitability Index (PI):</strong> This is the ratio of the present value of future cash inflows to the initial investment. A project with a PI greater than 1 is accepted. It is particularly useful for ranking projects when there is capital rationing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 3: The Financing Decision (Capital Structure & Cost of Capital)</h2>
            <p>Once a firm has decided on its investments, it must decide how to finance them. The financing decision involves determining the optimal mix of debt and equity, known as the capital structure. This decision involves a trade-off between risk and return.</p>

            <h3>3.1 Cost of Capital</h3>
            <p>The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return a company must earn on its investments to satisfy its investors. It is the weighted average of the costs of the different sources of finance used by the firm (debt, equity, preference shares). It is a critical input in capital budgeting decisions (as the discount rate) and in evaluating the firm's performance.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost of Debt (Kd):</strong> The interest rate a company pays on its borrowings, adjusted for taxes since interest is a tax-deductible expense.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost of Preference Capital (Kp):</strong> The dividend rate on preference shares.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost of Equity (Ke):</strong> The return required by equity shareholders. It is the most difficult to calculate and can be estimated using models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or the Dividend Discount Model (DDM).</li>
                <li><strong>Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):</strong> This is the overall cost of capital for the firm, calculated by weighting the cost of each source of capital by its proportion in the capital structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 Capital Structure Theories</h3>
            <p>These theories examine the relationship between a firm's capital structure and its value. The key question is: can a firm increase its value by changing its mix of debt and equity?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Net Income (NI) Approach:</strong> Argues that a firm can increase its value by increasing the proportion of debt in its capital structure because debt is a cheaper source of finance than equity.</li>
                <li><strong>Net Operating Income (NOI) Approach:</strong> Argues that the capital structure is irrelevant to the value of the firm. The value is determined by the firm's operating income and business risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Modigliani-Miller (MM) Approach:</strong> In a world with no taxes, MM argued that capital structure is irrelevant. However, when corporate taxes are introduced, they showed that the value of the firm increases with leverage due to the tax shield on debt.</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional Approach:</strong> A compromise view that suggests there is an optimal capital structure where the WACC is minimized and the value of the firm is maximized.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 4: The Dividend Decision</h2>
            <p>The dividend decision determines what portion of the firm's earnings should be distributed to shareholders as dividends and what portion should be retained for reinvestment in the business. This decision affects both the firm's financing and its stock price.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dividend Policy Theories:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Walter's Model & Gordon's Model:</strong> These models argue that dividend policy is relevant and affects the value of the firm. They suggest that the optimal dividend policy depends on the relationship between the firm's rate of return (r) and its cost of capital (k).</li>
                        <li><strong>Modigliani-Miller (MM) Hypothesis:</strong> This theory argues that, under certain assumptions (like no taxes and no transaction costs), dividend policy is irrelevant to the value of the firm. The value is determined solely by the firm's earning power and investment policy.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Forms of Dividends:</strong> Dividends can be paid in cash or in the form of a stock dividend (bonus shares).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 5: Working Capital Management</h2>
            <p>While capital budgeting deals with long-term assets, working capital management is concerned with the management of current assets and current liabilities. It is crucial for maintaining the firm's liquidity and day-to-day operations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concept of Working Capital:</strong> Gross working capital refers to the firm's total investment in current assets. Net working capital is the difference between current assets and current liabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Management of Current Assets:</strong> This involves managing the key components of current assets:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cash Management:</strong> Ensuring the firm has enough cash to meet its obligations, while not holding excessive idle cash.</li>
                        <li><strong>Receivables Management:</strong> Setting credit policies and managing the collection of accounts receivable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Determining the optimal level of inventory to hold to balance the costs of holding inventory against the costs of stockouts. Techniques like the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model are used.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
