            <h2>Introduction: The Big Picture</h2>
            <p>While microeconomics focuses on individual markets and decision-makers, macroeconomics looks at the bigger picture. It studies the behaviour and performance of an economy as a whole. For business managers, understanding the macroeconomic environment is crucial as it shapes the opportunities and threats their firms face. Factors like interest rates, inflation, and overall economic growth directly impact business costs, revenues, and investment decisions. This course will provide you with the framework to understand these economy-wide phenomena and the policy debates surrounding them.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: Measuring the Macroeconomy</h2>
            <p>To understand the economy, we first need to measure it. This module introduces the key variables that macroeconomists use to track the health of the economy.</p>
            
            <h3>1.1 National Income Accounting</h3>
            <p>National income accounting is a bookkeeping system that a government uses to measure the level of the country's economic activity in a given time period.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gross Domestic Product (GDP):</strong> The market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. GDP is the most comprehensive measure of a country's production and is a key indicator of its economic health.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Components of GDP (Expenditure Approach):</strong> GDP (Y) = Consumption (C) + Investment (I) + Government Purchases (G) + Net Exports (NX).</li>
                        <li><strong>Real vs. Nominal GDP:</strong> Nominal GDP is valued at current prices, while Real GDP is valued at constant prices, thereby adjusting for inflation. Real GDP is a better measure of economic growth.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Other Measures of Income:</strong> Gross National Product (GNP), Net National Product (NNP), National Income (NI), Personal Income (PI), and Disposable Personal Income (DPI).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Inflation and Unemployment</h3>
            <p>These are two of the most important and closely watched macroeconomic problems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> A sustained increase in the overall level of prices in the economy.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Measuring Inflation:</strong> The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the most common measure, tracking the cost of a typical basket of goods and services purchased by consumers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Causes of Inflation:</strong> Can be caused by an increase in demand (Demand-Pull Inflation) or a decrease in supply (Cost-Push Inflation).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Unemployment:</strong> The state of being jobless and actively seeking work.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Measuring Unemployment:</strong> The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Types of Unemployment:</strong> Frictional (short-term, between jobs), Structural (mismatch of skills), and Cyclical (due to business cycles).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: The Real Economy in the Long Run</h2>
            <p>This module focuses on the long-term determinants of economic growth and living standards.</p>

            <h3>2.1 Production and Growth</h3>
            <p>Why are some countries so much richer than others? This section explores the factors that determine a country's long-run economic growth.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> The key determinant of living standards. It is the amount of goods and services produced from each unit of labor input.</li>
                <li><strong>Determinants of Productivity:</strong> Physical capital, human capital, natural resources, and technological knowledge.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Policy and Growth:</strong> Governments can foster economic growth through policies that encourage saving and investment, promote education and health, protect property rights, and encourage research and development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 3: The Economy in the Short Run: Business Cycles</h2>
            <p>This module focuses on the short-run fluctuations in economic activity, known as the business cycle, and develops the primary model macroeconomists use to understand them.</p>

            <h3>3.1 Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply (AD-AS)</h3>
            <p>The AD-AS model is the workhorse model used to explain short-run fluctuations in economic activity around its long-run trend.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aggregate Demand (AD) Curve:</strong> Shows the quantity of goods and services that households, firms, the government, and customers abroad want to buy at each price level. It is downward sloping.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregate Supply (AS) Curve:</strong> Shows the quantity of goods and services that firms choose to produce and sell at each price level. In the long run, the AS curve is vertical, but in the short run, it is upward sloping.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Fluctuations:</strong> The model is used to analyze the short-run effects of shifts in either aggregate demand or aggregate supply, which cause business cycles (recessions and expansions).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 4: Macroeconomic Policy</h2>
            <p>This module examines the two main tools governments and central banks use to influence the macroeconomy: fiscal policy and monetary policy.</p>

            <h3>4.1 Monetary Policy</h3>
            <p>Monetary policy is conducted by a nation's central bank (e.g., the Reserve Bank of India). It involves managing the money supply and interest rates to achieve macroeconomic objectives.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Money Market:</strong> The theory of liquidity preference explains how the supply and demand for money determine the equilibrium interest rate.</li>
                <li><strong>Tools of Monetary Policy:</strong> The central bank's primary tools include open-market operations, the reserve requirement, and the discount rate (or repo rate in India).</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on Aggregate Demand:</strong> By changing the money supply and interest rates, the central bank can influence investment and consumption, thereby shifting the aggregate demand curve to combat recessions or inflation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.2 Fiscal Policy</h3>
            <p>Fiscal policy is the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy. It is conducted by the government.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Impact on Aggregate Demand:</strong> Changes in government purchases directly shift the AD curve. Changes in taxes shift the AD curve by influencing household consumption and firm investment.</li>
                <li><strong>The Multiplier Effect:</strong> An initial change in government spending can lead to a larger change in aggregate demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic Stabilizers:</strong> Features of the fiscal system, like the tax system and unemployment benefits, that automatically work to stabilize the economy without any deliberate action by policymakers.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Module 5: Money and Banking</h2>
            <p>This module explores the role of money in the economy and the banking system that helps create it.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Functions of Money:</strong> Medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.</li>
                <li><strong>The Banking System:</strong> We examine the role of commercial banks and the central bank. A key concept is fractional-reserve banking, which allows banks to create money through the process of lending.</li>
                <li><strong>The Quantity Theory of Money:</strong> A theory asserting that the quantity of money available determines the price level and that the growth rate in the quantity of money available determines the inflation rate.</li>
            </ul>
