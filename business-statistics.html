            <h2>Introduction: Making Sense of Data</h2>
            <p>In today's data-driven world, the ability to understand and use statistics is a critical managerial skill. Business Statistics is the science of making decisions under uncertainty. It provides the methods to convert raw data into meaningful information that can be used for planning, control, and decision-making. This course is structured to take you from the basics of describing data to the more advanced techniques of making inferences and predictions from data.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: Descriptive Statistics</h2>
            <p>Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the main features of a collection of data. This module focuses on the tools needed to turn a large dataset into a concise and understandable summary.</p>
            
            <h3>1.1 Data Collection and Presentation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Types of Data:</strong> Distinguishing between qualitative and quantitative data, and between discrete and continuous data.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Methods of collecting primary data (e.g., surveys, experiments) and secondary data.</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency Distributions and Graphical Presentation:</strong> Techniques for organizing and visualizing data, including frequency tables, histograms, bar charts, and pie charts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Measures of Central Tendency</h3>
            <p>These are single values that attempt to describe a set of data by identifying the central position within that set of data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The arithmetic average of a set of numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value in a sorted dataset. It is less affected by outliers than the mean.</li>
                <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.3 Measures of Dispersion (Variability)</h3>
            <p>These measures describe the spread or variability of the data. They tell us how much the individual data points differ from the central tendency.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Range:</strong> The difference between the highest and lowest values.</li>
                <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the Mean.</li>
                <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> The square root of the variance. It is the most widely used measure of dispersion and indicates the average distance of data points from the mean.</li>
                <li><strong>Coefficient of Variation:</strong> A relative measure of dispersion, used to compare the variability of two or more datasets with different means.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: Probability and Probability Distributions</h2>
            <p>Probability is the language of uncertainty. This module provides the foundation for inferential statistics by exploring the laws of probability and the properties of common probability distributions.</p>

            <h3>2.1 Basic Probability Concepts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Concepts:</strong> Random experiment, sample space, event.</li>
                <li><strong>Rules of Probability:</strong> Addition rule, multiplication rule, and conditional probability.</li>
                <li><strong>Bayes' Theorem:</strong> A method for revising a probability given new information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Probability Distributions</h3>
            <p>A probability distribution is a mathematical function that provides the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes in an experiment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discrete Probability Distributions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Binomial Distribution:</strong> Used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials (e.g., the number of defective items in a batch).</li>
                        <li><strong>Poisson Distribution:</strong> Used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space (e.g., the number of customers arriving at a service counter per hour).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Probability Distribution:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Normal Distribution:</strong> The most important distribution in statistics. It is a bell-shaped curve that describes many naturally occurring phenomena. It is the foundation for much of inferential statistics.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 3: Inferential Statistics</h2>
            <p>Inferential statistics allows us to make inferences or generalizations about a large population based on data from a smaller sample. This is where statistics becomes a powerful tool for decision-making.</p>

            <h3>3.1 Sampling and Sampling Distributions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sampling:</strong> The process of selecting a subset of a population for study. We discuss different sampling methods like simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling.</li>
                <li><strong>Sampling Distribution:</strong> The probability distribution of a sample statistic (like the sample mean). The Central Limit Theorem is a key concept here, stating that the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal for large sample sizes, regardless of the population distribution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 Hypothesis Testing</h3>
            <p>Hypothesis testing is a formal procedure for investigating our ideas about the world using statistics. It is most often used by scientists to test specific predictions, called hypotheses, that arise from theories.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Process:</strong> Involves setting up a null hypothesis (H0) and an alternative hypothesis (H1), choosing a level of significance (alpha), calculating a test statistic, and making a decision to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.</li>
                <li><strong>Types of Tests:</strong> We cover tests for a single population mean (z-test and t-test), tests for the difference between two population means, and tests for proportions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 4: Relationship between Variables</h2>
            <p>This module focuses on statistical techniques used to analyze the relationship between two or more variables. This is crucial for forecasting and prediction in business.</p>

            <h3>4.1 Correlation Analysis</h3>
            <p>Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Correlation Coefficient (r):</strong> A value between -1 and +1 that indicates the strength of the relationship. A value near +1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship, a value near -1 indicates a strong negative linear relationship, and a value near 0 indicates a weak or no linear relationship.</li>
                <li><strong>Important Note:</strong> Correlation does not imply causation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.2 Regression Analysis</h3>
            <p>Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely used for prediction and forecasting.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Linear Regression:</strong> Involves one independent variable. We use the method of least squares to find the "best fit" line (y = a + bx) that describes the relationship.</li>
                <li><strong>Coefficient of Determination (R-squared):</strong> A measure of how well the regression line fits the data. It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.</li>
            </ul>
