            <h2>Introduction: Law as the Framework of Commerce</h2>
            <p>Business Law provides the legal framework within which all commercial activities take place. Understanding this framework is not just for lawyers; it is an essential skill for managers to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and ensure compliance. This course prioritizes the Indian Contract Act, 1872, as it establishes the universal legal principles that underpin nearly every business transaction, from hiring an employee to selling a product. The focus extends beyond mere legal definitions to the practical rights, obligations, and remedies available in common business scenarios.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: The Indian Contract Act, 1872 (General Principles)</h2>
            <p>This is the most extensive part of the course, covering the law that governs the vast majority of business agreements. It follows a logical progression from the formation of a contract to its potential breach and subsequent resolution.</p>

            <h3>1.1 Formation of a Contract</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Agreement and Contract:</strong> Defines key terms and establishes the core formula: Contract = Agreement + Enforceability by Law.</li>
                <li><strong>Essentials of a Valid Contract:</strong> Details the essential elements required for an agreement to be legally enforceable, as outlined in Section 10 of the Act.</li>
                <li><strong>Offer and Acceptance:</strong> Covers the legal rules for a valid offer and acceptance, and the principles governing their communication and revocation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.2 Core Elements of a Valid Contract</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consideration:</strong> Defines consideration as "something in return" (quid pro quo) and explains the legal rules and exceptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity of Parties:</strong> Discusses who is competent to contract, focusing on the legal status of minors and persons of unsound mind.</li>
                <li><strong>Free Consent:</strong> Explains that consent must be free from any vitiating factors, defining and distinguishing between Coercion, Undue Influence, Fraud, Misrepresentation, and Mistake.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.3 Performance and Discharge of Contract</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance of Contract:</strong> Covers who can demand and perform a contract, and the rules related to a valid offer of performance (tender).</li>
                <li><strong>Discharge of Contract:</strong> Explores the various ways a contract can come to an end, including discharge by performance, mutual agreement, impossibility (frustration), and breach.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>1.4 Remedies for Breach of Contract</h3>
            <p>Details the legal recourse available to the aggrieved party when a contract is broken.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Damages:</strong> The right to claim monetary compensation for loss or damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Specific Performance:</strong> A court order requiring the breaching party to perform their contractual obligation.</li>
                <li><strong>Injunction:</strong> A court order restraining a person from doing a particular act.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: The Sale of Goods Act, 1930</h2>
            <p>This part applies the general principles of contract law to the specific context of buying and selling goods.</p>
            
            <h3>2.1 Formation and Terms of the Contract of Sale</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sale vs. Agreement to Sell:</strong> Defines a contract of sale and distinguishes between a 'Sale' (where ownership transfers immediately) and an 'Agreement to Sell' (where ownership transfers in the future).</li>
                <li><strong>Conditions and Warranties:</strong> Explains the difference between a Condition (a stipulation essential to the main purpose of the contract) and a Warranty (a collateral stipulation).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Transfer of Ownership and Rights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transfer of Ownership:</strong> Outlines the rules for determining when the ownership (property) in goods passes from the seller to the buyer, as the risk of loss generally follows ownership.</li>
                <li><strong>Rights of an Unpaid Seller:</strong> Details the specific rights available to a seller who has not been paid, including the right of Lien (to retain possession) and Stoppage in Transit.</li>
            </ul>
