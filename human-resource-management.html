            <h2>Introduction: People as a Strategic Asset</h2>
            <p>Human Resource Management (HRM) is the process of managing people in organizations in a structured and thorough manner. It covers the fields of staffing (hiring people), retention of people, pay and perks setting and management, performance management, change management, and taking care of exits from the company to round off the activities. This is the formal side of the Human Resources management (HRM) function. The informal or soft side of HRM is the process of managing people in the organization as a whole. This course will take you through the entire employee lifecycle, from planning for human resources to managing their departure, emphasizing the strategic role HRM plays in achieving organizational goals.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: Introduction to Human Resource Management</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Nature and Scope of HRM</h3>
            <p>This section introduces the fundamental concepts of HRM, tracing its evolution and defining its modern strategic role.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meaning and Definition:</strong> HRM is the function within an organization that focuses on the recruitment of, management of, and providing direction for the people who work in the organization. It is the organizational function that deals with issues related to people such as compensation, hiring, performance management, organization development, safety, wellness, benefits, employee motivation, communication, administration, and training.</li>
                <li><strong>Evolution of HRM:</strong> HRM has evolved from a purely administrative function (Personnel Management) focused on compliance and record-keeping to a strategic partner that is involved in key business decisions. This evolution reflects the growing recognition that people are a key source of competitive advantage.</li>
                <li><strong>Objectives of HRM:</strong> The primary objective of HRM is to ensure the availability of a competent and willing workforce to an organization. Other objectives include meeting the needs of individual employees, creating a positive work environment, and ensuring legal compliance.</li>
                <li><strong>Functions of HRM:</strong> HRM functions can be broadly classified into two categories:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Managerial Functions:</strong> Planning, Organizing, Directing, and Controlling.</li>
                        <li><strong>Operative Functions:</strong> Procurement (recruitment & selection), Development (training), Compensation, Integration (motivation & communication), and Maintenance (health & safety).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: Procurement of Human Resources</h2>
            <p>This is the first operative function of HRM, focused on securing the right number of people with the right skills at the right time.</p>
            
            <h3>2.1 Human Resource Planning (HRP)</h3>
            <p>HRP is the process of forecasting an organization's future demand for, and supply of, the right type of people in the right number. It's a systematic process of matching the internal and external supply of people with job openings anticipated in the organization over a specified period.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Job Analysis and Design</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Job Analysis:</strong> The process of studying and collecting information relating to the operations and responsibilities of a specific job. The immediate products of this analysis are <strong>Job Descriptions</strong> (a statement of the tasks, duties, and responsibilities of a job) and <strong>Job Specifications</strong> (a statement of the skills, knowledge, and abilities required to perform the job).</li>
                <li><strong>Job Design:</strong> The process of organizing work into the tasks required to perform a specific job. Techniques include job rotation, job enlargement, and job enrichment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.3 Recruitment and Selection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recruitment:</strong> The process of searching for prospective employees and stimulating them to apply for jobs in the organization. It is a positive process.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sources of Recruitment:</strong> These can be internal (e.g., promotions, transfers) or external (e.g., advertisements, employment agencies, campus recruitment).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Selection:</strong> The process of picking individuals who have relevant qualifications to fill jobs in an organization. It is a negative process, as it involves eliminating unsuitable candidates. The selection process typically includes several steps, such as preliminary interviews, application blanks, written tests, employment interviews, medical examinations, and reference checks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 3: Development of Human Resources</h2>
            <p>Once employees are hired, the focus shifts to developing their skills and capabilities to meet both current and future job requirements.</p>

            <h3>3.1 Training and Development</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Training:</strong> A planned process to modify attitude, knowledge, or skill behavior through learning experience to achieve effective performance in an activity or range of activities. Its purpose, in the work situation, is to develop the abilities of the individual and to satisfy the current and future needs of the organization.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Training Methods:</strong> Can be On-the-Job (e.g., coaching, job rotation) or Off-the-Job (e.g., lectures, case studies, simulations).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Management Development:</strong> The process of developing the skills and knowledge of managers to improve their performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 Performance Management and Appraisal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance Appraisal:</strong> The systematic evaluation of the performance of employees and to understand the abilities of a person for further growth and development. It is a key input for decisions on promotions, transfers, and terminations.</li>
                <li><strong>Appraisal Methods:</strong> Can be traditional (e.g., rating scales, ranking) or modern (e.g., Management by Objectives (MBO), 360-Degree Feedback, Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (BARS)).</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Management:</strong> A continuous process of identifying, measuring, and developing the performance of individuals and teams and aligning performance with the strategic goals of the organization. It is broader and more proactive than performance appraisal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 4: Compensation and Maintenance</h2>
            <p>This module focuses on rewarding employees for their contributions and ensuring their well-being, which is crucial for motivation and retention.</p>

            <h3>4.1 Compensation Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Job Evaluation:</strong> A systematic process of determining the relative worth of jobs in an organization to establish a rational pay structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Components of Compensation:</strong> Compensation includes direct financial payments (wages, salaries, incentives, bonuses) and indirect payments (fringe benefits like insurance, paid leave).</li>
                <li><strong>Incentive Plans:</strong> Pay plans that tie compensation to some measure of performance. Can be individual (e.g., piece-rate) or group-based (e.g., profit sharing).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.2 Employee Well-being and Industrial Relations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Employee Health and Safety:</strong> Organizations have a legal and moral obligation to provide a safe and healthy work environment. This includes measures to prevent accidents and promote employee wellness.</li>
                <li><strong>Industrial Relations:</strong> The relationship between employers and employees. It covers areas like trade unions, collective bargaining, and the settlement of industrial disputes. Maintaining harmonious industrial relations is essential for organizational productivity and peace.</li>
            </ul>
