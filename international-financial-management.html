            <h2>Introduction: Finance in a Global Context</h2>
            <p>International Financial Management (IFM) is a specialized area of finance that deals with the financial decisions of multinational corporations (MNCs). In today's globalized economy, businesses are increasingly involved in international trade and investment. This creates new opportunities but also exposes firms to new risks, most notably foreign exchange risk. IFM provides the framework for making financial decisions in this complex international environment. It applies the core principles of corporate finance to a global setting, addressing issues such as how to manage cash flows in different currencies, how to finance international operations, and how to make cross-border investment decisions.</p>

            <h2>Module 1: The International Financial Environment</h2>
            <p>This module provides an overview of the global financial landscape in which multinational corporations operate.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Globalization and the MNC:</strong> Understanding the motivations for companies to go global, such as seeking new markets, lower costs, or raw materials.</li>
                <li><strong>The Foreign Exchange Market (Forex/FX):</strong> This is the largest financial market in the world, where currencies are traded.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Its primary function is to facilitate the transfer of purchasing power between countries, provide credit for international trade, and provide hedging facilities to manage exchange rate risk.</li>
                        <li><strong>Participants:</strong> Major players include large commercial banks, central banks, corporations, and speculators.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Balance of Payments (BOP):</strong> A systematic record of all economic transactions between the residents of a country and the rest of the world in a given period. The BOP is composed of the Current Account, the Capital Account, and the Financial Account.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 2: Exchange Rate Determination and Forecasting</h2>
            <p>Exchange rates are one of the most important prices in an open economy. This module explores what determines the value of a currency and the challenges of forecasting its future movements.</p>

            <h3>2.1 Exchange Rate Regimes</h3>
            <p>Countries can choose different systems for managing their currency's value:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed Exchange Rate:</strong> The value of the currency is pegged to another currency or a commodity like gold.</li>
                <li><strong>Floating Exchange Rate:</strong> The value of the currency is determined by the market forces of supply and demand.</li>
                <li><strong>Managed Float:</strong> A hybrid system where the central bank intervenes in the forex market to influence the exchange rate.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Theories of Exchange Rate Determination</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Purchasing Power Parity (PPP):</strong> A theory which states that the exchange rate between two currencies is equal to the ratio of the currencies' respective purchasing power. In the long run, exchange rates should move towards the rate that would equalize the prices of an identical basket of goods and services in any two countries.</li>
                <li><strong>Interest Rate Parity (IRP):</strong> A theory which states that the interest rate differential between two countries is equal to the differential between the forward exchange rate and the spot exchange rate. It connects interest rates, spot exchange rates, and forward exchange rates.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 3: Foreign Exchange Risk Management</h2>
            <p>This is a core topic in IFM. Fluctuations in exchange rates can have a significant impact on a firm's profitability and value. This module covers how to measure and manage these risks.</p>

            <h3>3.1 Types of Foreign Exchange Exposure</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Transaction Exposure:</strong> The risk that the value of future cash flows from existing contractual obligations will be affected by changes in exchange rates. For example, an Indian exporter who has sold goods to a US buyer for dollars faces the risk that the dollar will depreciate against the rupee before payment is received.</li>
                <li><strong>Translation Exposure (Accounting Exposure):</strong> The risk that a firm's consolidated financial statements will be affected by changes in exchange rates when foreign subsidiary accounts are translated into the parent company's currency.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Exposure:</strong> The risk that a firm's future cash flows and market value will be affected by unexpected changes in exchange rates. This is the broadest measure of exposure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2 Hedging Techniques</h3>
            <p>Hedging is the process of taking a position to offset a potential loss. Firms use various financial instruments and techniques to manage their foreign exchange exposure.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Internal Techniques:</strong> Leading and lagging, netting.</li>
                <li><strong>External Techniques (Financial Derivatives):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Forward Contracts:</strong> An agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of a currency at a specified exchange rate on a specified future date. It locks in a future exchange rate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Futures Contracts:</strong> Similar to forwards, but are standardized and traded on an exchange.</li>
                        <li><strong>Options Contracts:</strong> Give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a currency at a specified exchange rate. Options provide flexibility and are used to hedge against downside risk while retaining upside potential.</li>
                        <li><strong>Swaps:</strong> An agreement between two parties to exchange cash flows in different currencies.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Module 4: International Financing and Investment Decisions</h2>
            <p>This module applies the principles of corporate finance to the international context.</p>

            <h3>4.1 International Financing</h3>
            <p>MNCs have access to a wider range of financing sources than domestic firms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Equity Markets:</strong> Raising equity capital by listing on foreign stock exchanges.</li>
                <li><strong>Eurocurrency Markets:</strong> A market for borrowing and lending currencies outside their country of origin.</li>
                <li><strong>International Bond Markets:</strong> Issuing bonds in foreign countries or in foreign currencies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4.2 International Capital Budgeting</h3>
            <p>This involves evaluating investment projects in foreign countries. The process is more complex than domestic capital budgeting due to several factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash Flow Estimation:</strong> Must consider the impact of foreign taxes, exchange rates, and potential restrictions on repatriating profits.</li>
                <li><strong>Discount Rate:</strong> The cost of capital for a foreign project may be different from the domestic cost of capital due to differences in risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Political Risk:</strong> The risk of loss due to political instability or changes in government policy in the host country.</li>
            </ul>
